# The Great TIGER Roadtrip
In preparation for State of the Map US 2024 in Salt Lake City, Utah I am planning to review all of the unreviewed TIGER roads on a theoretical roadtrip from Brooklyn to Salt Lake City. Join me with your own TIGER roadtrip!

## Dependencies
This project relies on Valhalla for routing. I used a self hosted server because the public instance only allows routes up to 1500km. It would be possible to set up the route in multiple segments and request from the public API. Just note that I have done nothing to limit request rates in the route matching portion.
